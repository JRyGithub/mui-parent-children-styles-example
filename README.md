# MUI Styled and tss-react/mui Styles

With material UI v5 there is a new way to override a children's css classes.

In the repo there are 4 examples, 2 showing creating a normal styled button with both `@MUI/material/Styled` and `tss-react/mui`.

Then there are two examples showing a parent component writing over these styles. You can decide which you prefer.
